\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is only ever \textit{exactly one} binding to any given resource.

    \item A variable owns what it is bound to.

    \item When a variable's lifetime goes out of scope the bound resources are freed.

    \item We may transfer ownership to something else. The moved values are then
          owned by something else.

    \item A binding may be able to borrow a resource from another binding and
          use it before it returns it to the original scope.

    \item A binding may be able to mutate a resource that it borrows as long as
          it has not been lent out to more than one binding.

    \item More than one binding may borrow a resource but they may not mutate it.
