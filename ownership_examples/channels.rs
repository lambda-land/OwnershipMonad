 * This example will create a shared channel that can be sent 
 * along from many threads.
 * Rust's channels can be used to communicated both messages and ownership
 * between threads.
 *
 * An excerpt from the Rust Programming Languages blog:
 *
 *   "A channel transfers ownership of the messages sent along it, 
 *    so you can send a pointer from one thread to another without 
 *    fear of the threads later racing for access through that pointer. 
 *    Rustâ€™s channels enforce thread isolation."
